# Who I am 

  * Pablo Escobar Lopez

  * Linux/HPC systems engineer

  * EasyBuild user since ... 2014?

  * Easybuild contributor

    * Mainly bioinfo easyconfigs
    * Some easyblocks, some small tweaks in the framework
    * Bug hunter

---

# My Cluster

  * [sciCORE - Scientific computing facility at the University of Basel](https://scicore.unibas.ch/) 
  
  * Near ~8k x86_64 CPUs (multiple cpu generations)

  * Infiniband networking (multiple infiniband islands)

  * 3.5PB storage
    * GPFS
    * BeeGFS

  * Some GPUs
  
  * CentOS 7
---

# My Cluster


  * Around ~1k user accounts

  * Between 50 to 100 different active users every day

  * Many different workloads (bioinfo, physics, chemistry, economics...

---

# My Cluster

### Near 1500 modules created with easybuild (lua format)

```terminal
[user@scicore ~]$ find /scicore/soft/modules/all/ *.lua | wc -l 
1475
```

### Lmod for modules management

```terminal
[user@scicore ~]$ ml -v

Modules based on Lua: Version 7.4.5  2017-04-04 08:58 -07:00
    by Robert McLay mclay@tacc.utexas.edu
```

# EasyBuild setup
  
  * Two dedicated accounts for easybuild

    * easybuild user: Test and Development

    * soft user: Deployments to production
  
  * `eb --optarch=GENERIC`

  * Main toolchains `goolf/1.7.20` and `intel/2017.01`

  * [RPATH](http://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/RPATH-support.html) enabled by default ... since months ago
---

# EasyBuild setup

We use gitlab too keep track of installed easyconfigs and notify the admins about new software installations

# What is RPATH

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath)

```text
In computing, rpath designates the run-time search path hard-coded 
in an executable file or library. Dynamic linking loaders use the 
rpath to find required libraries.

Specifically it encodes a path to shared libraries into the header 
of an executable (or another shared library). This RPATH header value 
(so named in the Executable and Linkable Format header standards) 
may either override or supplement the system default dynamic linking 
search paths.
```

RPATH takes precedence over $LD_LIBRARY_PATH (which is the most commonly used in environment modules)

```text
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated set of directories where 
libraries should be searched for first, before the standard set of directories
```
---

# How is RPATH support enabled in EasyBuild

From the [official EasyBuild docs](http://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/RPATH-support.html#implementation)

.small[When EasyBuild is configured to use RPATH, wrapper scripts are put in place for the dynamic linker commands (ld, ld.gold), as well as for every compiler command that is part of the toolchain being used. This is done during the prepare step.

The wrapper scripts will analyze and rewrite the list of arguments supplied to the command they are wrapping as needed, i.e.:

* inject an -rpath argument for every -L argument that specifies a library directory (with some exceptions, see also Filtering RPATH entries via --rpath-filter)
* lter out arguments that affect RPATH (e.g., --enable-new-dtags)
* sure that the library subdirectories (lib, /lib64) of the installation directory also have an RPATH entry
* include additional arguments related to RPATH (e.g. --disable-new-dtags)
]

# Why RPATH

We have many unexperienced users who don't know what `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is (and don't care at all)

Many of the bioinfo workflows executed in the cluster require to load many modules together. 

Unexperienced users start mixing modules (even if it's no allowed by default) and end up with unpredictable environments ... only god knows what libraries they are using.

By using RPATH we assure that if app "X" has been linked with library "Y" this library will be used on runtime, 
no matter what mess the user has done with his/her environment (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`)

# RPATH advantages

I don't need `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to find the proper libraries: 

```terminal
[user@scicore ~] module list
No modules loaded

[user@scicore ~] echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

[user@scicore ~]
```


```terminal
[user@scicore ~] ldd /scicore/soft/apps/SAMtools/1.3-goolf-1.7.20/bin/samtools
  linux-vdso.so.1 =&gt;  (0x00007f23f5717000)
  libncursesw.so.6 =&gt; /scicore/soft/apps/ncurses/5.9-goolf-1.7.20/lib/libncursesw.so.6 (0x00007f23f54ae000)
  libm.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f23f519c000)
  libz.so.1 =&gt; /scicore/soft/apps/zlib/1.2.8-goolf-1.7.20/lib/libz.so.1 (0x00007f23f4f86000)
  libdl.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f23f4d82000)
  libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /usr/lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f23f4b66000)
  libc.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f23f47a4000)
  /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x000056012848f000)
```

# RPATH advantages

And binaries can be executed even if I don't load any module or define `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

```terminal
[user@scicore ~] module list
No modules loaded

[user@scicore ~] echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

[user@scicore ~]
```

```terminal
[user@scicore ~] /scicore/soft/apps/SAMtools/1.3-goolf-1.7.20/bin/samtools --help | head -3

Program: samtools (Tools for alignments in the SAM format)
Version: 1.3 (using htslib 1.3)
```

# RPATH exceptions?

There are few applications which I have to build without RPATH enabled in easybuild.

For those I use `toolchainopts = {'rpath': False}`

Right now we only have 7 exceptions in the cluster:

```terminal
[user@scicore installed_easyconfigs] grep -R "{'rpath': False}" * | wc -l
7
```

Most of those apps provide 'exotic' build systems where injecting the RPATH flags require some test and debug.

They can probably be fixed to be built with RPATH but IMHO it's not worth the time.

# RPATH

## So you don't need $LD_LIBRARY_PATH at all ?

Well....yes and no....

You don't need `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for applications in the cluster software stack  __built with easybuild__ 
but many users still want to compile their own code on top of the cluster software stack and they don't use easybuild

That's why all our modules still provide `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (runtime) and `$LIBRARY_PATH` (build time)

```terminal
[user@scicore ~] ml --redirect show SAMtools/1.3.1-goolf-1.7.20 | grep LIBRARY_PATH

prepend_path("LD_LIBRARY_PATH","/scicore/soft/apps/SAMtools/1.3.1-goolf-1.7.20/lib")
prepend_path("LIBRARY_PATH","/scicore/soft/apps/SAMtools/1.3.1-goolf-1.7.20/lib")
```

# RPATH 

## And what problems I found? 

Sometimes (not often) enabling the RPATH support in easybuild can introduce "obscure" errors

We do all the test installations and easyconfigs development with user "easybuild" __without RPATH enabled__

We only enable RPATH when deploying to production with "soft" user. This way if the problem was introduced
when enabling the RPATH support we can easily identify it.

# RPATH

## And how many new tickets you got since you enabled RPATH ?

We got no tickets or user complains since we enabled the RPATH support in EasyBuild

99% of users haven't noticed the change.

The 1% who noticed it is because I told them

# RPATH

## Possible issues? 

Maybe some applications haven't been properly linked with RPATH but we haven't notice it yet
because we still define `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the modules

## Have you reviewed all your 1400 installations to make sure that RPATH is used in every binary?
